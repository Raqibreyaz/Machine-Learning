# Machine Learning - Summary of Journey So Far:
This repository tracks my journey in learning Machine Learning with Python. I started from the basics, exploring the need for machine learning, data gathering, and data cleaning techniques. I dive into data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA), gradually building my skills and understanding. My goal is to document each step and share my progress as I move through various learning stages, including more advanced concepts.

Feel free to explore my notebooks and code as I continue to expand my knowledge in machine learning
