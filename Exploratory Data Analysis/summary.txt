two types of data: 
    1.numerical:
            height,weight,age
    2.categorical:
            country,name,college

**univariate analysis: 
analysing a single column or feature.

#assume a column named survived where it has two values either 0 or 1 , so on analysing it we will plot its data

    1.lets say we used count plot to plot the count of people who survived and not survived,it will count 0 and 1 draw a bar chart of it,

    2.if we take the box plot it give 5 number summary:
    minimum, interquartile range(IQR), maximum, to detect the amount of data noisy and outlier

    q1=25 percentile
    q2=50 percentile
    q3=75 percentile

    interquartile range (IQR)= q3 - q1
    minimum = q1 - 1.5*IQR
    maximum = q3 + 1.5*IQR

    3.analysing the skewness of the data, lets say students in a test got marks, if we analyse it via plotting like x marks got by y number of students, now draw an ogive of the distribution, the curve will define the skewness

**multivariate analysis:analysing multiple columns or features

#while analysing the tips dataset we got an almost linear graph where on increasing the totalbill tips is increasing
    1.applied more analysis like the distinction of female and male , smoker or not, and size by no of customers for that bill


#assume we are using the titanic dataset where we are analysing the class and age columns
    1.in class 1 people are in age 36 around,
    in class 2 people are in age 29 around
    in class 3 people are in age 25 around

    2.applied analysis in the titanic dataset using heatmap on the count of survival for each class and results in light and dark color range depending on the count of survival

    3.grouped by gender and the embarked station and plotting a pie chart against survived
    found that most survivors are women and are coming embarking from C

    4.using clustermap saw the relationship of people with parch against survived

#analysing the flights dataset 
    1.using the heatmap saw that most passengers are looking for summer time for flight like months of june to aug
   
    2.used the line plot , saw that there is almost an increasing rate of passengers on every further year

#analysing the iris dataset
    1.got to know about the pair plot and overall summary of the data it shows by leveraging all the columns and showing the relationship
